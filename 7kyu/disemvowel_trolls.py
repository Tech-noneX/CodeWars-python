Task:
Some pesky trolls are spamming your comment section, 
and the best way to deal with them is to take away all the vowels from their messages!

Write a function that takes a string and returns 
a new version of the string with all the vowels (a, e, i, o, uâ€”both uppercase and lowercase) removed.

The letter y is not considered a vowel for this task.

Examples:

Input: "Protect your code from trolls!"
Output: "Prtct yr cd frm trlls!"

Input: "Amazing developers unite!"
Output: "mzng dvlprs nt!"

Input: "HELLO world"
Output: "HLL wrld"
